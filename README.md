# Acoustic Materials
View the dashboard on Tableau Public by clicking [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/AcousticMaterials/Dashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

The purpose of this project was to compare the effectiveness of each material at various 1/3 octave band center frequencies. This serves as a guide for selecting the right product for sound treatment. 

## Views
Each item was catagorized in Tableau in order to filter by product brand.
